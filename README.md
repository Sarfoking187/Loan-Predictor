# 💸 Loan Default Prediction System

This is an interactive **Loan Default Prediction Web Application** built with **Streamlit**, leveraging machine learning and advanced data visualization techniques to assess the likelihood of loan default. It is designed for use by financial institutions, loan officers, and analysts to support data-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Key Features

### ✅ Data Upload & EDA
- Upload your own CSV loan dataset.
- View descriptive statistics, missing value analysis, and feature summaries.
- Visualize:
  - Distributions of numerical and categorical features.
  - Target variable balance (default vs non-default).
  - Correlation heatmaps.
  - Interactive scatterplots (e.g., Debt-to-Income vs Credit Score).

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Intelligent pipeline for:
  - Missing value imputation (median for numeric, mode for categorical).
  - Standardization of numerical data.
  - One-hot encoding of categorical data.
- Saves preprocessed dataset for reuse and model training.

### 📊 Feature Selection
- Correlation-based filtering.
- Sequential Feature Selector using Logistic Regression.
- Interactive evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1.
- Feature importance bar plots.

### 🧠 Model Training
- Trains a **Random Forest Classifier**.
- Hyperparameter tuning (number of trees, depth, bootstrap settings).
- 5-fold Cross-Validation.
- Model is saved and reused for prediction and evaluation.

### 📈 Model Evaluation
- Displays confusion matrix.
- Shows precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 Score.
- Bar plot of feature importances.
- Saves evaluation results for auditing.

### 🧮 Interactive Predictions
- Input new applicant data via form.
- Real-time default probability predictions.
- Risk classification:
  - ✅ Low Risk
  - ⚠️ Medium Risk
  - 🚨 High Risk
- Debt-to-income and collateral coverage ratios.
- Risk factor detection and warning alerts.

### 📘 Results Interpretation & Team Credits
- Summary of model performance.
- Business recommendations.
- Limitations and future directions.
- Group contributions and Streamlit deployment links.
